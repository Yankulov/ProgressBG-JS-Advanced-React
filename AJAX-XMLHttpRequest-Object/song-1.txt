"Lotus Inn"

Yeah

I saw you movin' on the dance floor
I caught you lookin' over at me and my friends
Got my attention, now I want more
I think we both know how this night's gonna end
The way that you move your hips to the rhythm of the beat
You got me so nervous, think I need another drink
But then you grabbed my hand, said, "Baby, come with me"
This wasn't a part of the plan, no

But you look, you look so perfect dancing next to me
I wish the sun would look the other way

'Cause I never want this night to end
Baby, we could turn back time
Do it all over again
Tomorrow we can press rewind
We're staying at the Lotus Inn
Baby, we could turn back time
Do it all over again
Tomorrow we can press rewind
I never want this night to end
